i have make the calculator using tkinter as instructed in module 11 , however i took an extra step and tried to make a replica of default calculator usually available on laptop and i have introduced multiple fail safe procedures for error handling.

In the Assignment text it was asked to submit via drive link, however i am submiting the project in github , if its not acceptable then i will submit it again via google drive link.
thanks for understanding.
